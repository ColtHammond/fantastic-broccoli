This weather dashboard is a simple web application that allows users to view current and 5-day weather forecasts for various cities. By default, the 15 most populous cities in the US are displayed as clickable buttons on the homepage. Users can also search for other cities using the search input.

When a city is selected, the dashboard displays the city's current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, alongside an icon representing the weather. Additionally, a 5-day forecast is presented, showing the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its frontend and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data.
